# Third-Party Audio Provenance

## formula_engine_body_loop.wav

This formula engine layer is an original generated audio asset created by
`scripts/generate_formula_engine_assets.py`. It is a deterministic mono
22.05 kHz PCM WAV file synthesized from harmonic, pulse, and seeded-noise
layers; no third-party samples are used.

The bundled loop is derived from a user-downloaded Pixabay MP3 source. The
source MP3 is decoded into a temporary mono WAV, then the processor selects a
stable high-energy 3.2 second engine window, smooths sharp spikes, applies a
gentle low-pass blend, stabilizes short amplitude-envelope lumps, converts it
to mono 22.05 kHz PCM WAV, removes DC offset, crossfades the tail into the
head, matches the final loop seam, and normalizes conservatively below
clipping. The MP3 source is intentionally not packaged with the game.

The bundled clips are derived from a user-downloaded Pixabay MP3 source. The
source MP3 is decoded into a temporary mono WAV, then the processor selects
three distinct high-frequency squeal regions, converts each to mono 22.05 kHz
PCM WAV, removes DC offset, crossfades each tail into its head, and normalizes
below clipping. Each clip also gets a short loop-seam match so runtime volume
tapers can enter and exit without edge clicks. The MP3 source is intentionally
not packaged with the game.

The original WAV download requires a Freesound login, so the bundled loop is
derived from the public Freesound preview. The processor converts it to mono
22.05 kHz PCM WAV, removes DC offset, trims the quiet lead-in to the musical
onset, fades in over the first five seconds, crossfades the tail into the
head, and normalizes below clipping.
